# Docs

- This docs contains useful information that helped me build this API and there references
- It can be useful in other projects and for others

## Server.js

```
const port = process.env.PORT || 8000;
```

- This ``` || 8000; ``` part is really important because the port can't be fixed.
- Heroku dinamically assigns a port to the app, so you need to use this to work with heroku
    - source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15693192/heroku-node-js-error-web-process-failed-to-bind-to-port-within-60-seconds-of

```
const corsOptions = {
    origin: process.env.ENDPOINT,
    optionsSuccessStatus: 200
};
```

- So this configuration is important to only allow calls from the specific endpoint 
- The configurations can be found in express site
    - source: https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html

```
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test') {
    app.server = app.listen(port);
    console.log(`listening on port ${port}`);
}
```

- We only listen if it's not NODE_ENV of test
- This env variable is automaticly defined
    - source: https://blog.campvanilla.com/jest-expressjs-and-the-eaddrinuse-error-bac39356c33a


```
app.use(bodyParser.json()); 
```

- support json encoded bodies

## tests

- We use it instead of tests because it is an alias for test
